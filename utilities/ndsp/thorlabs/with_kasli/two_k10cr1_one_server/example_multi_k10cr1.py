"""
Control two K10CR1 units with only one NDSP server, where the calls to the
NDSP object are made from a kernel.

1. connect thorlabs K10CR1 rotators to your machine with USB, and make sure
the serial numbers in the device_db match the rotators you connected.

2. open a terminal in the same directory as this script, 
enter your artiq virtual environment, then run the 
NDSP server for this test with

    python launcher_multi_rotor.py

3. In another terminal in this directory in the artiq environment,
run this script with artiq:

    artiq_run example_multi_k10cr1.py --device-db=.\device_db.py

If you wanted to connect to multiple K10CR1 units, at least if we stick to the
way this example is structured using the K10CR1_NDSP_Driver class, you would need 
to launch a separate server for every Thorlabs rotator, which is probably not a 
good solution. A better solution would have only one server for all the K10CR1 units,
and this is what the K10CR1_Multi_NDSP_Driver tries to accomplish. See the multi
examples."""
