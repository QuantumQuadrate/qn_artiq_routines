"""
For scanning a defined experiment function over an ExperimentVariable

In many cases, we want the flexibility to be able to scan an experiment over a wide range of parameters--
in principle, over any of the defined ExperimentVariables. Including all of these as ARTIQ ScanVariables
in the GUI would be cumbersome for one experiment, not to mention including this for several experiments.
This code allows the user to scan up in up to 2 dimensions by supplying ExperimentVariables by name,
corresponding python sequences defining the scan steps, and an experiment function defined in
utilities/experiment_functions.py. As some of these variables pertain to hardware settings, such as DDS power,
it is necessary in general to re-initialize hardware at each scan step. We accomplish this by calling
base.build before each call of the experiment function, i.e., at the start of each scan step.
