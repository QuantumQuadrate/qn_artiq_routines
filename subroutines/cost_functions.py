"""
Functions which can be used for optimization of various experiment variables

Note: for uniformity, I generally try to have the best cost be -100. This is
not required, but it makes it less likely that we will forget to correctly specify
the target cost to the optimizer

Adding new cost function:
1. The name of each function below MUST end in 'cost'
2. The cost function must take self as the first and only argument,
which is a reference to an experiment. This allows the cost function
to reference the self.counts we care about without needing to pass in self.counts
explicitly thus allowing us to keep the interface general.
3. The cost returned by the function must be a float.

See GeneralVariableOptimizer.py to use these functions.
